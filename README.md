# debate-game

This plugin enables anyone to create or participate in public or private multiplayer debates that use gpt4 as the judge.

# How It Works

- **Private Debates**
    - Upon creation of a private debate the user is provided with a key. This key is meant to be shared with one other person (**and no one else**) you'd like in the debate.
    - Participants then take 2 turns making arguments for the topic.
    - Once the debate is over, you can ask for the score.

- **Public Debates**
    - Upon creation of a private debate the user is provided with a key. This key is meant to be shared with one other person (**and no one else**) you'd like in the debate.
    - Participants then make arguments at will.
    - A leaderboard is maintained, and similar to the private debate, you can ask for variouss scores.
